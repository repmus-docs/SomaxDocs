\section{The Somax Back-end Implementation} \label{ch:implementation}
This chapter presents the realization of the theoretical framework described in \cite{somaxtheory2021}. In particular, an overview of the back-end of the architecture, which is written in Python, as well as the implementations of certain  algorithms of relevance to the model is presented here. This chapter describes the architecture that has been in use since version 2.0 of Somax, which due to the latest\footnote{as of 2021-04-12.} version 2.3 contains some slight amendments that will be presented in chapter \ref{sec:wireless}, which describes the updated front-end, as well as a multithreaded solution for the architecture described in this chapter. Regardless, what's presented in this chapter is still relevant for version 2.3 and necessary to understand before reading chapter \ref{sec:wireless}.
